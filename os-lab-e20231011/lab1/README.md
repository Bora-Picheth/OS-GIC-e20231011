# OS Lab 1 Submission

Copy this template to `os-lab-YOUR_ID/lab1/README.md` in your own repository. Follow [the instructions](lab1-instruction.md). Your prediction and checkpoint answers are already saved by `oslab`; do not copy them here.

## Task 1: Operating System Identification

Briefly describe what you observed about your OS and kernel. Which number is the kernel version, and which is the distribution version?

Kernel version: 7.0.0-38-generic and Distribution version: Ubuntu 26.04.1 LTS

## Task 2: Essential Linux File and Directory Commands

maple.txt
This is file garden
This is file maple

## Task 3: Package Management Using APT

Explain the difference you observed between `remove` and `purge`.

<!-- SCREENSHOT REQUIREMENT: your terminal after the purge, showing `ls -ld /etc/mc` and your prompt. -->

## Task 4: Programs vs Processes

Briefly describe how you ran a background process and found it in the process list. What is the difference between a program and a process? What did you see before, during and after?

.Currently to run a background process we learn to use it with sleep command. Example: sleep 30 & echo "Hello"
.To check running process I use command "ps" which list all running process.
.Program is an app or instruction that store on system.
.Process is an active running program on the system.

## Task 5: Multitasking

Briefly describe the multitasking you saw. How many `sleep` lines did `ps` show? What does that show about the system, and what does it **not** show about how the processor is shared?

<!-- SCREENSHOT REQUIREMENT: your terminal with the `ps` result and your prompt. -->

## Task 6: Virtualization and Hypervisor Detection

State whether your system is running on a virtual machine or physical hardware, based on the command outputs.

<!-- SCREENSHOT REQUIREMENT: your terminal with the output of the four commands and your prompt. -->

## My Prediction: Confirmed or Corrected

For each prediction answer (`oslab predict lab1`), write **confirmed** or **corrected** and what you saw that shows it. You test the third answer (`apt-get remove`) in Task 3.
